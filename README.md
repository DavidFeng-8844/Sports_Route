# This is a repository to store the routes of GPS sports like cycling and trail running. I am using the route from Xingzhe website's route feature(here)[https://www.imxingzhe.com/lushu/] to export it as GPX. Then I import the file to COROS Mobile Apps. The GPS devices that I am currently using includes COROS Pace2 and XOSS G+. The routes include the following sports: 
## Cycling 
## Running 
## Trail Running
